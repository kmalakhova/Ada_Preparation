puts "\nThe Beach\
\n
Hooray! Summer is finally here, and that means we\ 
can go to the beach! Today, my family is going to #{city} \
Beach, and I can bring a friend with me. I decide to invite \
my best friend #{friend}. I know #{friend} will want to go with us. \
She thinks going to the beach is #{adjective}! \
\n
We start our beach day by watching the sunrise, and then \
eating breakfast at Uncle #{male}'s Pancake Hut. I always get \
#{food} flavored pancakes. \
\n
After breakfast we #{present_tense} the waves, go #{verb_ing} for seashells,\ and #{present_tense2} a sandcastle. Then we eat the lunch we packed for \
the beach. It's my favoriteâ€”#{food2} sandwiches. The only \
time #{food2} sandwiches are not so #{adjective2} is when you drop \
them in the sand.
\n
By #{time}, everyone's had enough of the beach. But #{city} \
Beach is fun at night, too! There is a really #{adjective3} \
boardwalk. It's always crowded with people. Would you \
believe we saw my teacher #{teacher} there, eating a huge #{food} \
split?\
\n
There are a lot of cool shops on the boardwalk. You can get \
a little hermit #{animal}, but make sure your mom and dad say \
it's okay! My favorite store is the jewelry store. \
#{friend} and I each buy a rope bracelet that will #{present_tense4} \
when it gets wet. Pretty #{adjective4}! \
\n
By #{time}, we're all ready to head home. \
I usually fall asleep on the ride home. \
I can't wait to go to #{city} Beach again."
